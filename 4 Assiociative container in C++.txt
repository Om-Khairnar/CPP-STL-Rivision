1) Set
2) Multiset 
3) Map 
4) Multimap 



These are the following which comes under the associative containers  

map: here each key we create must be unique. 
ex: map geek_no; // Here first data type is key and second data type is value

set: here also key we create must be unique but one important distinction from map is that here the value itself acts as a key so it means that elements in set are unique i.e. no repetition. 
ex: set s; // value itself acts as a key.

multimap : same as map but here key need not to be unique. 
ex: multimap geeks_no;

 multiset: same as set but here uniqueness of elements doesnâ€™t matter i.e. we can have same element multiple time unlike set. 
ex: multiset marks;
